1. AI can contribute to mental health education and support by providing preliminary assessments through diagnostic tools and wearable devices. For example, devices such as the Spire Health Tag and Moodmetric continuously monitor stress levels, sleep quality and other physiological indicators, offering real‐time feedback that helps users understand the link between their daily habits and mental well‐being. In addition, AI‐powered chatbots offer accessible, personalised support and coping strategies, thereby increasing the reach of mental health services.

2. Several wearable devices are under development to monitor mental health. The Spire Health Tag, for instance, tracks activity levels, breathing patterns, stress and sleep quality, while Moodmetric measures electrodermal activity to assess stress levels in real time. These devices provide continuous, objective feedback on both physical and emotional states, which can be invaluable in early detection and management of mental health issues.

3. Both BERT and MentalBERT are sophisticated language models used for analysing mental health narratives. BERT demonstrates a robust ability to capture complex linguistic nuances even in the absence of explicit mental health keywords, making it highly adaptable for real‐world applications. MentalBERT, while designed specifically for psychiatric contexts, tends to rely more on specific topic-related words, which can limit its effectiveness when such terms are sparse. Both models are generally resilient to disruptions in sentence order, though neither is without limitations.

4. The use of mental health chatbots is influenced by several crucial factors, including the user’s inherent disposition to trust technology, the perceived explainability of the system, the quality of the information provided, and the degree of anthropomorphism attributed to the chatbot. Trust plays a pivotal role: positive ‘trusting beliefs’ (i.e. the perception that the AI is reliable and competent) enhance the user’s intention to engage, while concerns over privacy and health risks can reduce this intention if trust is lacking.

5. The effectiveness of AI language models in mental health applications is evaluated using both intrinsic and extrinsic methods. Intrinsic metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity and BERTScore assess the coherence and quality of generated language, while extrinsic metrics gauge performance in practical, real‐world settings. In addition, evaluations often include manual reviews and assessments of data privacy to ensure that sensitive information is handled appropriately.

6. The ‘Seeking Mental Health Care Model’ posits that help‐seeking behaviour for depression is influenced by multiple layers of factors. These include superordinate variables like stigma and treatment experiences, intermediate variables such as continuum and causal beliefs, depression literacy and self‐efficacy, and process variables that relate to the individual’s self-identification as having a mental illness. The model highlights that personal beliefs, societal perceptions and prior experiences collectively determine whether an individual will seek professional help.

7. Linguistic nuances and narrative analysis play a critical role in identifying mental health issues from social media data by moving beyond mere keyword detection. Deeply personal narratives, such as Expressive Narrative Stories (ENS), provide rich psychological insights that advanced models like BERT can decode to identify subtle linguistic patterns associated with mental health stressors. Furthermore, analysing cause and effect relationships within these narratives can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mental health challenges.

8. A range of NLP techniques are employed to analyse mental health texts. These include tokenisation (dividing text into words or subunits), Part-of-Speech tagging (assigning grammatical roles), TF-IDF (to identify the importance of terms), n-grams (to capture contextual sequences of words) and word embeddings (which represent words as vectors). Advanced models such as BERT, along with its variants like RoBERTa, ALBERT and MentalBERT, further enhance the analysis by effectively capturing context and subtleties within the language, thereby improving the precision of mental health assessments and predictions.
