## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a mental wellbeing chatbot that supports UON students by providing empathetic, context-sensitive advice. The solution:

- **Supports Mental Wellbeing:** Offers guidance on issues such as loneliness, isolation, and stress.
- **Operates Locally:** Utilizes a completely local AI model, ensuring data privacy and offline accessibility.
- **Is Research Driven:** Developed based on extensive primary and secondary research to ensure the design meets user needs without replacing professional mental health services.

## Key Components

### 1. Requirement Analysis & Research
- Conduct interviews and questionnaires with UON students.
- Analyze existing solutions and relevant literature.
- Define detailed requirements and establish project scope.

### 2. System Design & Development
- **Backend:** Implement dialogue management with RASA and a custom action server.
- **Model Building:** Create and fine-tune a dataset for both NLU and a generative LLM.
- **Frontend:** Develop a user-friendly interface that emphasizes accessibility, crisis management, and ease-of-use.
- **OLMoE.swift Xcode Project:**  
  Within the `OLMoE.swift` folder, there is an Xcode project located at:  
  `/Users/ryangichuru/Documents/SSD-K/Uni/2nd year/2nd Semester/AI Group Project/Misc/OLMoE.swift/OLMoE.swift.xcodeproj`  
  Open this project in Xcode, build, and run the app.

### 3. Evaluation & Testing
- Evaluate the chatbot with at least 10 external participants.
- Collect user interaction data and feedback.
- Perform unit and integration tests to ensure system robustness.

### 4. Project Management & Teamwork
- Regular team meetings, task tracking, and weekly progress presentations.
- Detailed documentation of individual contributions and overall project coordination.

## Ethical & Operational Considerations

- **Privacy & Safety:**  
  The chatbot is designed to work entirely on-device to maintain user privacy. It is not a substitute for professional mental health services.

- **Ethical Usage:**  
  All development follows the University of Northampton’s guidelines on academic integrity and ethical use of AI. Special care has been taken to address equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI).
