Timeline of Events/Topics

This timeline is organized by the general topics and development of AI in mental health, rather than specific chronological dates since many sources do not provide specific dates.

Early AI & Machine Learning Applications in Mental Health:
Development of early machine learning models using techniques like LSTM, CNN, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for analyzing mental health data.
Initial work focuses on analyzing text, audio, and basic clinical data for detecting depression, suicidal ideation, and other mental health issues. Datasets like DAIC, TwitSuicide, and DEPTWEET were utilized.
Early models struggle with low accuracy and have limitations in handling complex relationships in psychiatric data and data standardization.
Research identifies significant measurement biases, where algorithms are more accurate in certain demographic groups such as white men, compared to women and other ethnicities, due to issues in speech transcription and potentially other factors.
Introduction of Transformer Models:
Transformer models such as BERT and RoBERTa are introduced and show significant performance improvements over earlier methods for mental health detection tasks, leading to the creation of specialized models such as MentalBERT and MentalRoBERTa.
Focus shifts towards using context-aware pre-trained embeddings provided by BERT, Glove, and Word2Vec.
Transformer models begin to be used not just for text but also in other areas like medical image segmentation.
Research identifies biases in datasets leading to algorithms that are trained on these biased datasets to perpetuate those biases. Issues such as data collection bias, measurement bias and label bias are identified as key sources of inaccuracy in algorithms.
Algorithms built on biased data were found to over-associate certain occupations with men compared to women, reflecting historical sex bias in text data.
Concerns are raised regarding lack of diversity in teams building AI models, leading to potential issues with unchecked implicit biases.
Disproportionate use of datasets of primarily lighter-complexion individuals for facial recognition leads to poor performance with darker-complexion individuals.
Algorithms created to determine hate speech are found to improperly label African American's posts as hate speech, due to inaccuracies in data collection.
Multimodal AI & Advanced Techniques:
AI research begins focusing on combining multiple modalities like text, audio, and emotion recognition for more comprehensive mental health assessments, with models improving upon the initial generation of AI algorithms.
Advanced methods such as knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms are implemented to improve model performance and precision.
AI models begin to be used to conduct skills training based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and assist therapists.
Ethical issues surrounding privacy and data security become an increasing concern, and must be addressed for the continued development of AI in this field.
Large Language Models (LLMs) & Interpretability:
LLMs begin to be used in conversational AI for psychotherapy, offering a wider range of discussion topics in mental health.
LLMs begin to be employed in the role of psychological assessors.
The use of adaptive RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for more interpretable mental health screening becomes a topic of research.
Efforts are made to improve the interpretability of AI models to identify why and how they make their decisions, especially for complex tasks such as determining mental health diagnoses.
Research also starts comparing the output of LLMs to that of mental health professionals and the general public, identifying disparities in projected outcomes.
Models such as GPT-3, Bard, and Claude begin to be tested on their accuracy and interpretability.
LLM generated text for psychotherapy interventions are found to be very labor intensive for therapists to check and edit prior to discussion with patients.
AI models using arrest data to predict crime hotspots are identified as biased, because they disproportionately target areas that are already overpoliced.
LLMs are identified as having a higher success rate in predicting outcomes when trained on larger datasets that are not disproportionately skewed to any specific demographics, leading to further research into removing bias from the dataset.
Bias and Fairness Concerns:
Major focus on identifying and mitigating biases in AI applications for mental health to promote fairness and diversity, especially concerning race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status.
Specific biases are explored including:
Structural Inequalities: Sociocultural foundations and inequalities in education, housing, and healthcare are found to impact AI development.
Data Collection Bias: Datasets are found to be non-representative of various cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds.
Measurement Bias: The features used in the algorithms are not equally accurate across all groups.
Label Bias: Labels used for machine learning can be inaccurate.
Feature Selection Bias: When unrepresentative or inaccurate features are used to build models.
Sampling Bias: When the sample is not large or representative enough.
Evaluation Bias: When the training set is not representative, leading to inaccurate predictions when applied.
Deployment Bias: Using the models in contexts outside of which it was designed to be used.
User Interaction Bias: When the algorithm is being trained based on user interaction that introduces bias.

The research utilizes a likelihood ratio test to find the optimal k* for adaptive neighborhood of Reddit posts for each item-query to improve accuracy.
LLMs can be trained for specific therapeutic modalities, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as noted in "CBT-LLM- A Chinese Large Language Model for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based Mental Health Question Answering."
The example given, where the LLM responds to a prompt about loneliness and lack of social contact, shows how a CBT-informed response might be formulated.
LLMs can facilitate data collection in therapy. For example, an LLM could collect sleep diary data, expediting therapy sessions ("Large Language Models Behavioral Healthcare Proposal")
LLMs can provide a first pass at therapeutic support with some guidance by a human therapist.
Significance: LLMs hold the potential to make mental health support more accessible and scalable.
Bias in AI/LLM Applications for Mental Health:
Concept: Identifying and mitigating various biases that can arise during the development and deployment of AI models.
Findings:"A Call to Action on Assessing and Mitigating Bias in Artificial Intelligence Applications for Mental Health" provides an extensive taxonomy of bias types, including:
Sociocultural Foundations: Structural inequalities can influence data and perceptions.
Example: Children in under-resourced neighborhoods may have lower test scores due to limited access to educational resources, which might bias a model if not handled.
Data Collection: Representation bias (data not representative of all populations).
Speech datasets for mental health may not adequately capture the variety of speech patterns from different cultural and racial backgrounds.
Measurement Bias: Accuracy varies across groups.
Automated speech transcription might have higher error rates in women and some minority groups.
Label Bias: Inaccurate labels for training data leading to future incorrect predictions.
Twitter posts from African Americans might be inaccurately labeled as hate speech, leading to biased algorithms.
Feature Selection Bias: Inaccurate features selected.
Sampling Bias: Non-representative data.
Evaluation Bias: Inappropriate benchmarks.
Facial recognition models trained on mostly lighter-complexioned individuals might be inaccurately evaluated on darker-complexioned individuals.
Deployment Bias: Models used in unintended contexts.
Feedback Loop Bias: Existing bias is reinforced via human interaction and new data.
Predictive policing models using historical arrest data can disproportionately channel efforts into already over-policed communities.
Homogeneous teams can increase the chances of biases going unnoticed.
"Bias Discovery in Machine Learning Models" shows examples of how logistic regression models can have different accuracies for different groups with varying classification thresholds, and how methods like reweighing can mitigate this.
"Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Mental Health Analysis with Large Language Models" shows the F1 score and EO (equal opportunity) metrics, indicating varying levels of performance and bias across multiple models.
Significance: Addressing bias is crucial to ensure that AI tools are equitable and do not perpetuate existing disparities.
Technical Aspects of AI/LLM Models:
Concept: Examining the different models and techniques used in mental health applications.
Findings:Transformer Models: "Transformers and large language models in healthcare" and "A Comparative Analysis of Transformer and LSTM Models for Detecting Suicidal Ideation on Reddit"
Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms, are a popular choice for NLP tasks.
The documents explain the math behind transformers, showing how query, key and value matrices are produced and utilized in scaled dot product attention.
Transformer based models including BERT, RoBERTa and clinical variations of these models are frequently used for this purpose as shown in several documents.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Models: "A Comparative Analysis of Transformer and LSTM Models for Detecting Suicidal Ideation on Reddit"
LSTMs, often combined with attention mechanisms, are used to capture contextual information in text.
The researchers used pre-trained embeddings from BERT, Glove and Word2Vec for their word embeddings layer when training LSTM models.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Models: "Sleep Disorder Prediction in Asthma" uses CNN models on medical data to predict sleep disorders in asthma patients, using various layers, dropout and Adam optimization.
Significance: Understanding the specific strengths and limitations of different AI architectures is vital for effective model selection and implementation.
Integration into Clinical Practice:
Concept: Exploring ways to integrate AI tools into the workflows of mental health professionals.
Findings:"Large Language Models Behavioral Healthcare Proposal" proposes three levels of integration: AI as a tool, collaborative AI, and fully autonomous AI.
AI as a tool helps with specific tasks such as collecting patient data
Collaborative AI involves human in the loop with the AI as a driver assisting with tasks.
Fully autonomous AI can conduct therapy sessions with little or no involvement of a therapist.
"Artificial intelligence in mental healthcare- an overview and future perspectives" notes that clinicians interacting with AI may not necessarily perform better than each on their own.
Significance: Successful integration requires careful consideration of ethical issues, data privacy, and the potential impact on the therapeutic relationship.
Evaluation of LLM accuracy in mental health assessment
Findings:
In "Assessing prognosis in depression- comparing perspectives of AI models, mental health professionals and the general public," results indicate that LLMs like ChatGPT-4, Bard and Claude tend to be more optimistic than mental health professionals or the general public about treatment outcomes without professional help. This shows a potential weakness in the LLM's ability to understand and predict the complexity of mental health conditions.
The LLMs significantly underestimated the likelihood of a person not improving or getting worse without professional help.
Significance: Careful evaluation is needed to assure LLMs do not provide overly optimistic or inaccurate assessments.
Context-Aware Mental Health Analysis:
Concept: Improving accuracy by incorporating context in the form of conversation history.
Findings
In "Towards Interpretable Mental Health Analysis with Large Language Models," models with explicit context performed better than those without it. Additionally, adding emotion labels improved performance.
Example: The document gives examples of using emotional context in prompts when analyzing conversations to determine how a target utterance caused or did not cause a target emotion, using labels from the training data.
Significance: Context helps LLMs more accurately understand human interactions and thereby better detect mental health issues.
The Need for Fairness and Diversity:
Concept: Addressing the issue of bias and promoting representation in mental health AI.
Findings:"Promoting Fairness and Diversity in Speech Datasets for Mental Health and Neurological Disorders Research" notes a need to address various sources of bias when collecting data for speech analysis.
The document uses a checklist to identify whether datasets address issues like representation across demographics, socioeconomic status, language and the target disorders.
Significance: These documents make clear the need to create robust systems that reflect the diversity of human experience so as to create robust and equitable models.
Factors Influencing Intervention Effectiveness
Concept: Analyzing which factors influence the effectiveness of mental health interventions.
Findings:In "Mental Health Interventions Review", it was found that factors such as baseline mental health problems, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and socioeconomic variables can impact the effectiveness of mental health interventions.
Example: Exposure to adverse childhood events moderated the effect of an intervention on post-traumatic stress and dissociation.
Other factors like gender, ethnicity, and IQ did not moderate the effects on mental health outcomes.
Significance: These findings highlight the complexities of delivering effective interventions and the importance of tailoring approaches to individual circumstances.

Mental Health and AI: A Comprehensive Study Guide
Short Answer Quiz
What is the significance of F1 scores in the context of mental health detection models? F1 scores provide a balance between precision and recall, offering a comprehensive measure of a model's accuracy in identifying relevant instances, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets common in mental health classification. They indicate how well the model is both identifying cases and avoiding false positives and false negatives.
Explain the concept of "covariate shift" as it relates to AI models in mental health. Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of data used to train a model does not match the distribution of data it encounters during deployment. In mental health, this can lead to inaccurate predictions if the model is trained on a specific demographic but used on a different population with different characteristics.
What are some key challenges associated with using speech data for mental health analysis, particularly regarding bias? Speech data can be biased because automated transcription may be less accurate for certain demographic groups, such as women or minority ethnic groups. Additionally, accents and speech patterns vary across cultures, posing challenges to AI model generalization.
Describe the role of attention mechanisms in LSTM models used for mental health analysis. Attention mechanisms in LSTM models enable the model to focus on the most relevant words or parts of a sentence when analyzing text. This helps to capture contextual information and identify important indicators of mental health issues within a sequence of words.
In the context of bias mitigation, what is the purpose of reweighing in machine learning? Reweighing in machine learning adjusts the importance of different data points during training to reduce bias. For example, if a model performs poorly on a particular group, giving more weight to samples from that group can improve model fairness and accuracy.
How do structural inequalities contribute to bias in AI models for mental health? Structural inequalities, such as limited access to education or healthcare resources, can lead to biased data that reflects existing societal disparities. AI models trained on such data may perpetuate and even amplify existing injustices if not addressed proactively.
What is the distinction between "supervised" and "fully autonomous" AI in mental health interventions? Supervised AI tools assist in treatment where humans oversee the AI outputs and have the final say. Fully autonomous AI would autonomously perform most tasks, including diagnostics, intervention, and patient monitoring, with minimal human intervention.
Explain the concept of "feedback loop bias" in the context of predictive policing. Feedback loop bias happens when a model makes a prediction that subsequently alters the environment and data, reinforcing the original prediction. In predictive policing, this could lead to increased police presence in already over-policed areas, leading to more arrests, reinforcing biased training data and predictions.
Describe the purpose of the Likelihood Ratio test used when building adaptive neighborhoods. The Likelihood Ratio Test is used to determine the optimal size of an adaptive neighborhood for item queries by comparing models that assume constant or varying densities, selecting the model and corresponding neighborhood size that best fit the local embedding characteristics.
What is the role of "homogenous teams" in the development of AI that may perpetuate biases? Homogenous teams, composed of individuals with similar backgrounds and perspectives, are more likely to overlook biases because they lack the diverse viewpoints needed to identify and address the potential for systemic biases that can be present in the design or training of AI models.
Answer Key
F1 scores offer a balanced measure of a model's accuracy, especially with imbalanced datasets, reflecting how well the model identifies true positives while minimizing both false positives and false negatives.
Covariate shift refers to when training data and deployment data differ in distribution, which can cause AI models to be less effective if the model isn’t trained on data that is reflective of the deployment context.
Speech data can contain biases due to transcription errors, as some groups are more accurately transcribed than others, or may vary by cultural or linguistic differences affecting model generalization.
Attention mechanisms in LSTM models enable the model to focus on the most relevant parts of a sentence when analyzing text, which helps capture the crucial elements indicative of mental health issues.
Reweighing adjusts the importance of data points during training to reduce model bias, often by increasing the influence of samples from underrepresented groups in the training process.
Structural inequalities can result in imbalanced datasets that favor one group over another, influencing an AI model to perpetuate those inequalities and resulting in inequitable outcomes.
Supervised AI tools assist with treatment under human oversight, whereas fully autonomous AI performs most tasks independently, from diagnostics to intervention, with minimal human intervention.
Feedback loop bias happens when a model’s predictions alter the environment which then changes the data, reinforcing the original prediction; in policing, this can lead to over-policing of areas already more heavily policed.
The Likelihood Ratio Test is used to identify the best size of an adaptive neighborhood by assessing whether a constant or a changing density of data most likely represents the data within a given neighborhood.
Homogenous teams are more likely to overlook biases, because the lack of diverse perspectives can result in biases not being identified or addressed during the AI development process.

FAQ: AI in Mental Health
1. What types of data are being used to train AI models for mental health detection?
AI models for mental health detection are trained using a variety of data types, including text from social media (like Twitter and Reddit), audio recordings of speech, video footage, and clinical data such as medical records. These data often include information about the user's language use, emotional expression, and behavioral patterns. Multimodal approaches are increasingly popular, which combine data from text, audio, and sometimes even visual cues for more robust predictions. Some studies also incorporate physiological signals from wearables.

2. What are the main challenges in developing AI for mental health applications?
Several challenges exist. A major concern is the presence of bias in datasets, which can lead to models that are less accurate or fair for certain demographic groups (e.g. by race, gender, or age). This bias can arise from various sources, including how data is collected, labeled, or from underlying societal inequalities. Other challenges include the limited interpretability of some AI models, making it difficult to understand why they make specific predictions, and a lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, privacy and ethical concerns around using personal mental health data need careful consideration.

3. How can bias in AI models for mental health be identified and mitigated?
Bias can be discovered through careful examination of a model's performance across different subgroups, revealing if one group is predicted more accurately than another. Specific metrics like average odds difference are used to measure the bias in a model and help identify where imbalances exist. Techniques to mitigate these biases include re-weighing data to give more importance to underrepresented groups, adversarial training to make models less sensitive to sensitive attributes, and by ensuring teams developing AI have diverse backgrounds to help identify these implicit biases during development. Additionally, careful selection of features and proper data cleaning are also vital in reducing bias.

4. How do different AI models compare in their performance for mental health detection?
Various models are used, including traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines and Random Forests), and deep learning models (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers). Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, and their "mental health"-specific versions (MentalBERT, MentalRoBERTa) tend to outperform many other methods, especially when using text data. Performance is often measured using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score (measuring both precision and recall), sensitivity, and specificity. Generally, models that combine text and other modalities (like audio) tend to have better results than unimodal approaches.

5. What is the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health care?
LLMs show great promise for mental health applications. They can be used for tasks like identifying individuals at risk of depression or suicidal ideation, providing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based question answering, and analyzing user's mental states from conversation. They can also assist clinicians with tasks like summarizing patient notes, creating initial assessments, and even suggesting potential interventions, all while maintaining patient privacy. LLMs are also being explored for their ability to simulate human therapists in conversational psychotherapy, potentially increasing the availability of mental health support.

6. How are AI models being used to understand specific mental health conditions?
AI is being used to analyze various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Models are trained to detect the subtle nuances of language, sentiment, and behavior that might be indicative of these conditions. Research has shown that AI can analyze physiological markers like facial expressions, speech patterns, and even brain imaging (fMRI) to identify indicators of mental health disorders. AI also has the capacity to analyze user data over time to assess the long term development of these conditions, potentially providing insight on outcomes for patients.

7. What are the different levels of AI integration in mental health interventions?
AI integration in mental health care exists on a spectrum. Some AI applications are focused on automation of simple tasks such as generating summaries of session notes, freeing up clinicians' time. Collaborative AI, where a human therapist actively monitors and overrules the AI as needed is also commonly implemented. At the far end of this spectrum are fully autonomous AI systems that can deliver full-course therapy without human intervention. Fully autonomous systems have the potential to greatly increase accessibility to therapy, but these present significant challenges in safety, particularly when considering complex mental health challenges.

8. How does AI compare to human mental health professionals in assessing prognosis and treatment effectiveness?
Studies show that AI models, especially LLMs, can be quite effective in assessing the likelihood of full recovery and potential reoccurrence of mental health issues. However, there can be variations in these assessments compared to those of mental health professionals and the general public. While AI may sometimes lack some of the nuanced perspective of humans, they excel at identifying patterns across a large amount of data, and they can offer different viewpoints. The key to utilizing these systems successfully is collaborative care, where AI supports and enhances human expertise in order to create more well-rounded care for individuals.
