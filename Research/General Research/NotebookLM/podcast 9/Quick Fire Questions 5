How prevalent are biases in mental health AI, and how impactful are they?

Biases in mental health AI are prevalent and can have a significant impact, potentially exacerbating existing inequities in mental health care. These biases can arise from various sources, including biased training data, algorithmic design, and the way AI systems are implemented.
Prevalence of Biases:
•
Historical Biases: AI models can perpetuate historical biases present in research, such as the underrepresentation of diverse populations in research samples. This can lead to models that are not as effective or accurate for marginalized groups.
•
Data Bias: Biases can be introduced through unrepresentative sampling or inaccurate measurements. AI models trained on data that reflect historical inequalities tend to perform worse for marginalized groups, which can lead to inequitable treatment outcomes.
•
Linguistic Bias: Differences in word usage when describing different population subgroups can create bias. For instance, certain words may be more associated with one gender over another, leading to skewed results. Natural language processing (NLP) has been shown to produce significant performance biases across different genders, races, ethnicities, religions, sexualities, cultures, and ages.
•
Algorithmic Bias: AI algorithms can exhibit bias when their optimization metrics are not well-aligned with health equity. For example, an algorithm optimized for healthcare spending as a proxy for health was shown to lead to worse outcomes for Black patients. This occurs when the algorithm learns spurious correlations between patterns in the data and labels, rather than relying on relevant information.
•
Underdiagnosis Bias: AI algorithms can systematically underdiagnose certain populations, which can prevent them from accessing needed mental health services. For example, one study found a systematic underdiagnosis of female adolescent patients, with lower accuracy and a higher false negative rate compared to male patients.
•
Over-amplification bias: AI models can amplify discrepancies from training data, exacerbating existing inequalities.
Impact of Biases:
•
Inequitable Treatment: Biased AI models can lead to differential impacts on different groups, resulting in poorer health outcomes for underrepresented and underserved groups. This includes influencing who receives treatment, what treatment is administered, and what level of support is provided.
•
Misdiagnosis and Underdiagnosis: Low model performance due to biases can lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of mental health conditions for marginalized groups, perpetuating health disparities.
•
Perpetuation of Disparities: If AI models are built from historical data reflecting social biases and inequities, they can reinforce and even perpetuate existing inequities, differentially impacting who and how effectively a person is diagnosed and treated.
•
Reduced Access to Care: Biased algorithms can result in individuals in need of services not receiving them or people receiving services they do not need.
•
Erosion of Trust: The application of AI without transparency can erode patient trust, which reduces trust in the behavioral health profession. If patients and clinicians perceive automated AI decisions as more authoritative without understanding how those decisions were made, misdiagnoses can have a more damaging effect as they may be unwilling to question it.
•
Ethical Concerns: Biased algorithms and their problematic outcomes threaten the ethical use of AI-built models for mental health.
•
Limited Generalizability: AI models developed from homogeneous samples may not work well for groups not adequately represented in the data.
Specific Examples of Bias:
•
Facial recognition algorithms have demonstrated gender and racial bias, with better classification accuracy for males and lighter skin tones.
•
Risk prediction algorithms in healthcare insurance have shown racial bias, using healthcare spending as a proxy for health, despite differences in healthcare access.
•
Algorithms for diagnosing skin conditions have performed poorly when applied to people with different skin tones than those in the training data.
•
AI tools used for risk assessment have shown poor performance in predicting the risk of suicide for underrepresented demographic groups, including Black, Native American, and Alaskan patients.
•
Anxiety detection models can under-diagnose female adolescent patients due to disparities in information density and linguistic differences in patient notes.
•
A study on benzodiazepine prescriptions found that gender plays an unexpected role in model predictions.

Impeded Client Autonomy: Without understanding how decisions are reached and what information is being used, clients may feel disempowered, discriminated against, and unable to provide informed consent. This lack of transparency can impede a client’s ability to make autonomous decisions about their therapy.
•
Increased Risk of Automation Bias: The perception that algorithms or machines are more impartial can lead to automation bias, where patients and clinicians may be unwilling to question a misdiagnosis from an AI system, which can be more damaging than a human error. This can lead to an unjustifiable increase in trust in AI systems, potentially undermining human judgment and expertise.
•
"Hallucination" and Misinformation: AI chatbots can generate false or misleading information, known as "hallucination," which can be particularly dangerous in the context of mental health, potentially making existing anxieties worse or providing inaccurate advice. If the model mis-references earlier parts of a conversation, or misstates a fact or belief of the user, it can negatively impact the user's trust and immersion in the session.
•
Reduced User Engagement: When AI-generated responses demonstrate hallucinations, whether factual or perceived by the user, it can significantly affect the user experience and reduce their trust and immersion in the therapeutic process.
•
Clinician Mistrust: The "black box" nature of AI can also lead to clinicians’ mistrust or apprehension of the technology, thus making it more difficult to integrate it in clinical practice.
Despite these challenges, some argue that insisting on full transparency before clinical application can stifle innovation. Instead, they suggest focusing on transparency by providing high-level explanations of the model's selection process, the statistics of the training data, the training process, and any underlying assumptions. However, ethical considerations and the need for transparency and accountability demand the development and integration of explainable AI techniques to ensure patient autonomy, trust, and effective therapeutic outcomes.
To mitigate the negative impacts of the "black box" nature of AI, a "human-in-the-loop" approach is essential, incorporating human reviewers or therapists in real-time or post-hoc validation processes to help identify and rectify model hallucination instances, and ensure the provision of accurate and reliable responses.

•
Data Scarcity: These models often require large labelled data sets, which may not be readily available for many mental health applications.
Hybrid Approaches
•
Combining CNNs and LSTMs: Combining CNNs for feature extraction with LSTMs for sequential analysis can be effective for multimodal data. These models can capture both spatial and temporal patterns in data, which is beneficial for analyzing images, videos, and time-series data in mental health.
•
Using LLMs with RAG: LLMs can be enhanced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to improve their accuracy and reduce hallucinations. RAG allows models to draw on external knowledge sources, improving the quality of their outputs.
Conclusion While LLMs show great promise for understanding the subtleties of mental health narratives due to their contextual understanding, reasoning capabilities, and human-like language generation, they also have limitations in computational cost, data requirements, bias, and interpretability. Traditional models, including CNNs and LSTMs, are still valuable for their efficiency, and ability to perform feature extraction and sequential analysis. Hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both LLMs and traditional models are also being developed and show great promise. The choice of model depends on the specific task, available resources, and the desired balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
What impact do biases in speech data—such as transcription errors and accent variations—have on the accuracy of mental health assessments, and how can these challenges be addressed?

Biases in speech data, such as transcription errors and accent variations, can significantly impact the accuracy of mental health assessments. These biases can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inequitable treatment outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires careful attention to data collection, processing, and model development.
Here's a breakdown of how these biases affect mental health assessments and potential mitigation strategies:
•
Transcription Errors:
◦
Impact: Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, while advanced, are prone to errors. These errors can result in the loss of crucial context and details in transcripts. For example, questions and responses in interviews might be reduced to simple "yes" or "no" answers, or key phrases might be fragmented. Poor audio quality, background noise, and inconsistent loudness levels can further degrade the accuracy of ASR systems. Missing or duplicated words can also occur. Such inaccuracies can compromise the model’s ability to correctly assess mental health.
•
Mitigation:
◦
Utilize high-quality ASR systems like Whisper to generate more accurate transcripts.
◦
Implement speech quality assessment tools to identify and potentially exclude low-quality audio.
◦
Employ LLMs to extract significant topics related to mental health and address the issues of missing or duplicated words in the transcripts.
◦
Manually review and correct transcripts where possible, focusing on preserving important nuances in spoken language.
•
Accent Variations:
◦
Impact: AI-based speech recognition software often generates higher error rates for women and people from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. This is because speech patterns and accents vary across different demographic groups, and if the training data does not adequately represent these groups, the model will perform poorly on underrepresented speech patterns. Models trained primarily on English language data may not perform well on multilingual populations.
◦
Mitigation:
▪
Ensure diverse representation in training data by including varied accents and dialects to reduce bias and improve model performance across different populations.
▪
Use language-specific pre-training stages followed by shared fine-tuning to improve model applicability across different regions.
▪
Develop strategies to identify and mitigate bias in the development of speech datasets.
▪
Implement self-reported annotations for diverse identity attributes and collect aggregate data for sensitive attributes to enhance fairness and inclusivity.
•
Linguistic Bias:
◦
Impact: Linguistic patterns can contribute to bias in natural language processing (NLP) models used in healthcare. For example, gendered language can influence model predictions, leading to systematic underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis in certain groups. Differences in word distribution and information density between groups can also cause biased outcomes in AI predictions.
◦
Mitigation: * Neutralize biased language and normalize information density in clinical text data to reduce disparities. * Use post-processing techniques such as calibration to align predicted probabilities with actual observed distributions. * Transform linguistic embeddings by removing their projections onto the semantic subspace of the demographic aspect.
•
General Bias Considerations:
◦
Impact: AI models trained on skewed or unrepresentative data can produce inaccurate or discriminatory outcomes, particularly for underrepresented populations. Biases in data can result in AI models performing worse for marginalized groups, which leads to inequitable treatment outcomes.
◦
Mitigation:
▪
Implement bias mitigation techniques at various stages of algorithm development, spanning training data, algorithmic processes, tool transfer, and interpretation of findings.
▪
Ensure fair representation by balancing the distribution of demographics of participants in the datasets.
▪
Carefully examine model performance across sensitive attributes and combinations thereof.
▪
Involve diverse teams in the AI development process, including engineers, data scientists, clinicians, and other AI creators, to mitigate biases.
•
Data Quality and Privacy:
◦
Impact: The quality and consistency of data from electronic health records (EHR) can affect the model’s ability to generalize across different clinical settings. Variability in note quality between providers may introduce further bias. Moreover, the sensitive nature of mental health data necessitates strict privacy and security measures. Leaks of private information can lead to patient identification and public exposure of their mental health records.
◦
Mitigation:
▪
Implement data anonymization techniques, such as removing personally identifiable information (PII), voice anonymization, and face anonymization.
▪
Establish secure data storage protocols and ethical review processes.
▪
Regularly monitor and audit data handling practices to ensure compliance with security standards.
▪
Prioritize data quality by documenting recording settings, technical parameters, and the use of noise reduction systems.
By addressing these challenges, AI systems can be developed that provide more accurate, fair, and equitable mental health assessments that support diverse populations.
