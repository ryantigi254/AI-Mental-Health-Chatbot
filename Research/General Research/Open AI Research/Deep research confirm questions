The level of depth is super detailed very in depth, The timeframe of focus is 5 years or sooner however you can go back as far as 10 years looking into a historical view of what has been done, different early implementations. Since 10 years might not capture properly more older papers look for papers that look inti the history of the topic.

My prefferred sources are ArXiv, IEEE, PubMed, NCBI, ResearchGate, PMC NCBI , Semantic Scholar, you can use other sources however for sources outside this list only take papers that are published from USA, Australia and NewZealand, UK, Europe, Switzerland, china, japan,  universities or researchers.

The depth as I said is as in depth as it can be, make a report with detailed analysis, mathematical or AI components architecture reviews, benchmarks reviews, citations to be in harvard reference style and in full, a los do comparisons of different model types, clinical methods of treatment, different architectures and other comparisons that might be useful. Also have a proper full and complete reference list written in Harvard Style.

For the Research aim to look specifically at mental health in the UK with the different methods digital that are used whether AI or not, then using this as a focus expand out globally but focus on endeavors in the US, Europe, Australia and Newzealand, china, japan, and Switzerland. For the model used that can be from any part of the world. 

I would also like that you provide the output as a report add tables, architectures, metrcis, benchamark performances, bullet points but only when needed and return the full report in latex code.

Lastly I would like you to mainly focus on AI mental health chatbots as that's the research we are supposed to do, however after this look at it and research it from different views like a focus on mental health rather than AI  but still AI or something technological being used in mental health, then A focus on just the AI specifically and mental health covered slightly, and or chatbots focus as compared to ai chatbots in mental health, and other views you can look at this helps as get a well grounded overview of the topic as we don't just look at ai mental health chatbots but also other areas with the same topic in mind.
