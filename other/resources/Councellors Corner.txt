November 2024: Loneliness - Being Alone or Feeling Lonely: What is the difference?

Now Storm Bert has passed, the crispness in the air carries a subtle reminder of the colder, darker days ahead of us. We remain in a season of transition, a reflective pause as the cycle of the year turns once again. The steady rhythm of changing seasons mirrors the shifts in our own lives, reminding us of the inevitability of change and the emotional landscapes that accompany it. For many of us, this time of year can deepen feelings of loneliness, as the fading warmth of autumn gives way to the quiet introspection of winter. In an increasingly interconnected world, the concepts of being alone and feeling lonely are often used interchangeably and yet they are profoundly different experiences. Understanding this distinction can be transformative in addressing our own emotional wellbeing.

Being Alone: A Choice or Circumstance

Being alone refers to a state of physical solitude, which may arise from deliberate choices we make or situational factors. In the UK, where individualism is culturally valued, time spent alone is often viewed positively. This time can provide space for reflection, creativity, and personal growth. However, individualism is not universally valued in all societies. There are many contexts where a focus on group cohesion, interdependence and prioritising the needs of the community over the individual are more highly regarded.

Feeling Lonely: An Emotional State

Loneliness, by contrast, is a subjective emotional experience that we feel at different points in our lives. Sometimes, we may even feel lonely when we are surrounded by others. Commonly, people describe loneliness as a sense of emptiness, sadness, or longing for meaningful connection. Sometimes admitting to ourselves or others that we feel lonely can be hard and we might feel embarrassed or ashamed. If this sounds familiar, know that you are not alone in feeling this way. Loneliness affects all of us, across all demographics, at different points in our lives and your perception of this experience is uniquely yours.

The distinction between being alone and feeling lonely highlights the complex interplay between our physical environment and emotional landscape. Becoming mindful of how we respond to being alone and / or feeling lonely is a key part of learning how to manage going forwards. By connecting with our experiences, we gain a clearer understanding of what to expect from ourselves; what works, what doesn't, what we'd like to do more or less of and what support or help we may need.

Ideas for Bridging the Gap

Lean in to loneliness.

Explore what your feelings of loneliness mean to you. Loneliness can evoke different things in all of us; perhaps a sense of disconnection and longing, social isolation, unresolved trauma, feelings of inadequacy and so on. Giving yourself permission to lean into and lean from your loneliness can be challenging, but allowing yourself to feel that discomfort can also bring awareness to opportunities for change and teach you a lot about what your own needs are. Mindfulness is about learning to focus your attention, allowing you to notice your thoughts and worries coming and going, without fusing with them or ruminating. If you drift away, just notice what is happening and bring your attention back to whatever it is you have chosen to do. Further information about Mindfulness can be found online: [https://franticworld.com/free-meditations-from-mindfulness/](https://franticworld.com/free-meditations-from-mindfulness/). Try the Chocolate or Befriending meditation for something a little different.

Embrace aloneness.

Being alone without feeling lonely is a skill that involves shifting your mindset, building your relationship with yourself, and finding meaning in solitude. Remind yourself that being alone doesn't equate to being unloved or forgotten, it is a normal and often necessary part of life. Reframe solitude as a nourishing opportunity; a chance for personal growth and self-discover rather than isolation. Harness the benefits of being alone, whether that is walking in nature or enjoying a quiet evening at home, being alone can foster a sense of autonomy and inner peace.

Reconnect with yourself.

The most important relationship you will ever have in your life, is the relationship you have with yourself. Spending time alone can be a means of reconnecting with yourself, particularly if you are feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of work, university, or social expectations. Spend time really getting to know yourself; your passions, preferences, wants, needs and values.

Practice self-compassion.

Self-compassion is the practice of being kind and understanding to yourself and can be a powerful source of developing your resilience. Dr Kristin Neff describes self-compassion: [https://self-compassion.org/](https://self-compassion.org/) in the following way; "Self-compassion simply involves … giving yourself the same compassion you'd naturally show a friend when you're struggling or feeling badly about yourself. It means being supportive when you're facing a life challenge, feel inadequate, or make a mistake."


Validate your feelings and express yourself.

Words matter. When you're experiencing a strong emotion, take a moment to name it. Once you've identified it, try to think of two more words that describe how you're feeling and continue from there. This process can bring clarity to your emotions. The ability to understand, manage, and express your feelings is not fixed, and we can learn to regulate and manage our emotions throughout life. While some emotions may be universal, there is no one-size-fits-all emotional balance that works for everyone across all cultures. Journaling is one way that may help you make sense of your emotions, recognise patterns and find relief. The Center for Journal Therapy suggests using the acronym: WRITE to help you get started. 
* W - What topic do you want to write about? 
* R - Review or reflect on it.
 * I - Investigate your thoughts and feelings through your writings.
 * T - Time yourself to ensure that you write for at least five minutes (or whatever your current goal is). 
* E - Exit smart; strategically and with introspection.


Stay connected with others.

Being comfortable with your own company is a valuable skill that strengths your emotional wellbeing and enhances your relationships with others. Social connections vary for everyone and may include friends, family, colleagues, peers, online communities and more. Checking in with friends or family may help reduce feelings or disconnection. It's okay to start small and go slow. This could be something as little as smiling or saying hello to a cashier in your local shop, a neighbour, peer, or work colleague. If you are feeling isolated, engaging in shared hobbies, volunteering, or joining a new club or exercise group can be a great way to meet new people and connect with others. Find out more on Mind's website: [https://sidebyside.mind.org.uk/](https://sidebyside.mind.org.uk/).

Review your social media use.

For some people, social media can bring feelings of connection and enhances their relationships. For others, it can bring about feelings of loneliness and comparison with the representation of people's lives they see online. There is evidence for both sides of the debate – that it both enhances connection and enhances disconnection. Perhaps take some time to really think about how you engage with and use your social media – it's not about what is right or wrong. Instead, consider whether you feel more nourished than depleted or more depleted than nourished. Then think about whether you might want to make any small changes and review again. Continue until you have a balance that feels right for you.

_"Loneliness is a state of mind that causes us to feel empty, alone and unwanted. When we are lonely, we often crave human contact. Our state of mind often makes it difficult to form connections with others. In order to help overcome loneliness, I think it is very important to learn to be comfortable in our own company, as this is when we are more likely to open up to new people and make new connections. The most important relationship we will ever have in life is with ourselves, so it is important to make sure it is a good one."_

* Sarah Kinchin, UON Counsellor


_"Loneliness is something we can choose to harvest or let grow wild so it overcomes us to a point where we feel strangled, I choose to harvest and let it work in my favour, do something different. I was worried about joining a choir, I love to sing but because of my loneliness the little voice in my head said, 'they will laugh, they will know you can't sing' but they did none of these things, I was welcomed, and encouraged, soon the singing drowned out the doubting voice."_
 - _"I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel all alone." -Robin Williams_

Loneliness is something we all feel, and we can at times become stuck in it and not be able to get ourselves out of it. We can find it hard to do the very things that will get us out of it. Connecting with ourselves is something that can help with feelings of loneliness and help us to get out of that stuckness so we can go and do something about it. This video explores a few techniques that can help us to connect with ourselves. Funny cat videos are something that help me, so no surprise that such videos are referred to in the video…

October 2024: An ever-changing world: How we can navigate and live more comfortably with change.

Outside, I can already see the trees shifting from summer into autumn. The once bright green leaves are slowly giving way to orange and yellow. Though today, as I write, the sun still shines warmly like summer, there is a crispness in the air, a quiet reminder that winter is on its way. We are in a time of transition. Every year in the UK, this cycle continues as we move through spring, summer, autumn, and winter, only to begin again. The wheel is ever turning, the seasons change in a steady rhythm and so do our lives.

Some changes are so subtle, so woven into our routines, that we hardly ever notice them. Like the turning of the seasons, change happens around us, and we adapt with ease—putting on warmer clothes as the temperature drops. There is comfort in the flow and familiarity of these shifts. We have been through them before, and we know what to expect. But for others, especially those from places without such distinct seasons, these changes might feel more abrupt and unfamiliar. The way each of us responds to change is as unique as we are.

We often feel differently about changes we actively participate in compared to those that happen beyond our control or where we feel we have little control. Change, at its core, means some aspect of our experience is no longer the same, and with that comes a sense of loss. We lose what once was, and with it, sometimes the connection with something familiar. This is reflected in common phrases we often use; "Things will never be the same again" or "I wish I could go back to how things were." Even when life improves and we make intentional changes toward the life we desire, we can still feel a sense of loss.

We all experience change, though some of us find it more comfortable than others. At different stages of life, change either forces us out of our comfort zone, or we choose to step out of it ourselves. Our comfort zones are typically safe, familiar, and predictable spaces where we feel secure. However, growth and development often come from embracing new, challenging, or uncomfortable experiences, even if they involve failure or discomfort. There is a delicate balance between pushing ourselves just enough and pushing too far, which can lead to feelings of overwhelm or stress. Becoming mindful of how we react to change is a key part of learning how to manage it. By connecting with our experiences of change, we gain a clearer understanding of what to expect from ourselves; what works, what doesn't, what we'd like to do more or less of and what support or help we may need. 

Ideas for Managing Change

Focus on what you can change.

You can choose what you focus on and by doing this, you may feel more empowered and less helpless.

Work on letting go of what you cannot change.

One approach to this is a skill called Radical Acceptance, which was developed through Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This technique involves fully acknowledging and embracing challenging situations and emotions. By accepting things as they are rather than ignoring, avoiding, or wishing they were different, you create a foundation for moving forward. It is important to note, however, that radical acceptance does not mean agreeing with everything or giving in to circumstances that should be changed.

Embrace routine.

During times of change and uncertainty, sticking to a routine can provide a sense of stability and comfort. This could be something as simple as enjoying a morning coffee or reading a page from a favourite book before bed each night.

Practice self-compassion.

Self-compassion is the practice of being kind and understanding to yourself and can be a powerful source of developing your resilience. Increased resilience can help you figure different ways to adapt to and cope with changes. Dr Kristin Neff describes self-compassion in the following way; "Self-compassion simply involves … giving yourself the same compassion you'd naturally show a friend when you're struggling or feeling badly about yourself. It means being supportive when you're facing a life challenge, feel inadequate, or make a mistake." Find out more: [https://self-compassion.org/](https://self-compassion.org/).

Build your support networks.

Support networks vary for everyone and may include friends, family, colleagues, peers, online communities, professionals and more. When many things are changing, it can feel simpler to withdraw, but spending time with supportive people you trust can make challenging situations feel easier to manage. If you are feeling isolated, engaging in shared hobbies, volunteering, or joining a new club or exercise group can be a great way to meet new people and connect with others.

Counsellor Contributions

"Change is a natural part of life. For me, I try to remember that everything is temporary. I remind myself that the bad times won't last and to make sure I embrace and make the most of the good times. Trying to resist change can prevent you from accepting the current situation and moving forward. So, in the words of Michael Rosen in 'We're going on a bear hunt,' "We can't go over it. We can't go under it. Oh, no! WE'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH IT!" Sarah Kinchin, UON Counsellor

"For me change can be scary, it means coming out of your comfort zone or safe place to embrace the ability to evolve. We sometimes build things up to be by far worse than we think, only to find the change is great. We need to give ourselves time, love, and patience to enjoy the experience." Danny Davidson, UON Counsellor

Creative Visualisation Meditation: Change and Transitions

Creative Visualisation Meditation is a practice which blends meditation with guided visual imagery. It can help you with managing stress, anxiety, trauma, and depression. Through this process, it promotes mental clarity, inner peace, and a more positive outlook on life. Listen to the audio from Annalisa Froddosio, UON Counsellor, online: [https://mymedia.northampton.ac.uk/media/Oct.24+-+Change+%28AF%29/0_5zd0owv4](https://mymedia.northampton.ac.uk/media/Oct.24+-+Change+%28AF%29/0_5zd0owv4)

Breathing Technique 1: Change and Transitions

This video has the first of my breathing techniques. Follow the technique as shown in the video. The idea of noticing the calm and peace is that when we have been highly stressed and anxious for a long time, our body can forget how it feels to be calm and so can find it hard to get back to that calm. This helps our muscles, cells and neurones to recognise how it is to feel calm. This technique can really help when we are feeling stressed or anxious. But if we do it at other times too, we are more likely to think of it at times of high stress and anxiety.
