Mental Health Awareness Week - Moving more for our mental health

 During this year's Mental Health Awareness Week we are all being encouraged to move more for our mental health. This could be anything from having a walk in the fresh air, a dance around the kitchen or joining a new sports group.

Movement has great benefits for our health - both physical and mental but it can be difficult to find an activity that you enjoy and feel able to do.

Visit the university webpage to find different ways you can be more active whilst on campus(https://www.northampton.ac.uk/about-us/services-and-facilities/sport-at-uon/active-campus/) or come along to our very own running group, Threads, every Wednesday from 4pm outside the Waterside Restaurant.

Each week Counselling and Mental Health host daily drop-in sessions'. If you feel you need support or would like to speak to a member of the team, find out more on the Student Hub Page.



Join us to cut the waiting times of NHS mental health services.

Organised by St. Andrew's Healthcare and the University of Northampton
Time and location: Monday 13th May at 6.30pm in the Boardroom in the main building at St. Andrew's Healthcare, Billing Road, Northampton NN1 5DG.
We invite you to join a meeting to help us develop a new solution that will allow patients to access EMDR therapy much sooner and more often. EMDR Therapy is an effective therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression disorders. 

We will provide travel expenses (up to ¬£10) and also a thank you shopping voucher of ¬£20 to show our gratitude for your attending. Tea/coffee and refreshments will also be provided. 

The purpose of this meeting is to get a group of people together who may have undergone EMDR, or who may be suitable to undergo it in the future, and to demonstrate the technology to them and let them try it out. This will enable us to receive feedback and to get ideas on how we could potentially improve it. It will also allow us identify potential pitfalls or barriers that we may not have thought about that we can build into future trials of the product. Your thoughts and ideas will be invaluable to us moving forward. If the project receives funding, we hope that you will be able to join us on our steering group which will monitor the progress of the project and provide ongoing feedback. 

While we hope that you will be able to join us in person so we can show you the technology, there will also be the potential to join us remotely by teams ‚Äì please let us know if that would be preferable. 

How to join: email Dr Mu Mu mu.mu@northampton.ac.uk or ring/message 07720843510 to register your interest and receive further information.

Student Minds new 10 year strategy

We have a clear vision: No student should be held back by their mental health.

Our mission is to improve university communities so that every student gets the mental health support they need to reach their goals.

At Student Minds, we're a charity improving university communities. Around one in four students report having a diagnosed mental health issue while at university, and world events, navigating identity and discrimination can make student life even tougher.

We've already made great strides in creating change but there is more to do and we're energised to do it. Over the next ten years, we commit to:

Continue driving positive change for students - we'll keep working with students, the higher education sector, health sector and government to make student mental health a priority, and we'll continue empowering students to look after their own mental health.
Ensuring that positive change lasts - we'll focus on preventative, sustainable, long-term changes that will benefit future generations as well as the students of today.

Uncertain times: Anxiety in the UK and how to tackle it
The Mental Health Foundation (MHF) has chosen anxiety as their Mental Health Awareness Week 2023 theme to provide a better understanding of what anxiety is, when it becomes a concern, and what we can do to help ourselves and each other when anxiety starts to become a problem.
Read MHF's report on Anxiety in the UK to find out more.
11 May 2023
Mental Health Foundation
Anxiety is a normal emotion in us all, but sometimes it can get out of control and become a mental health problem.
Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems we can face. In a recent mental health survey we carried out around stress, anxiety and hopelessness over personal finances, a quarter of adults said they felt so anxious that it stopped them from doing the things they want to do some or all of the time. Six in ten adults feel this way, at least some of the time. On a positive note, anxiety can be made easier to manage.Visit the mentalhealth.org.uk website for MH Awareness Week sources.

Maybe it's turning up at a friend's door with a takeaway after a busy day, sending a meme you know they'll find funny, or being there when they're struggling.
