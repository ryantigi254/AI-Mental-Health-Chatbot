Anxiety and Panic Attacks
​anxiety-and-panic-attacks-header.jpg​​​

What is anxiety?
A normal feeling we all experience when faced with difficult or threatening situations. However, our bodies can over-react and respond with anxiety to something which isn't really dangerous and this stops us from coping with everyday activities. Our bodies react putting us in a fight, flight, or freeze m​ode. 

What is a panic attack?
A panic attack can be experienced by ​one in three people at some point in their lives. Symptoms include sweating, racing heart, rapid breathing, tense muscles, running away, fidgeting, nail biting and a mind full of worrying thoughts which are hard to dismiss like a fear of heart attack, not being able to brea​the, or losing control.

Ways to manage anxiety
​​Don't let stress build up. If something is worrying you, seek advice.
Avoid getting over-tired and make sure you take regular breaks from study or work.
When anxious, we breathe quickly (hyperventilate) and take in too much oxygen. This can lead to unpleasant feelings such as light headedness and numbness and tingling in hands, feet or lips. Make a conscious effort to slow down your breathing. ​​Counting in for 4 seconds and out for 6 seconds can help.
If you find this difficult, breathe into a paper bag or into hands cupped over your nose and mouth, this will restore the oxygen / carbon dioxide balance quite quickly.
Remember​ anxiety feelings are normal and harmless, if you wait the fear will pass.
Learn more about anxiety - the more you are able to understand anxiety  the less you will fear it. Check out the resources below or attend one of the Counselling and Mental Health Team drop-in sessions that take place Monday - Friday in the Learning Hub.
​Exams
​​If you suffer panic attacks in this situation, then you could apply for alternative exam arrangements to help you cope. Contact our Mental Health Adviser Service to arrange an appointment to discuss. 

Email: mha@northampton.ac.uk​ to book an appointment.​​​​​

Culture Shock:
Culture Shock


Culture shock is a common experience for people who move to a cultural environment which is different to their own. International students may experience it in varying amounts. There may be short-term feelings of disorientation while someone adapts to the many changes to their way of life. But in some cases people may experience confusion, anxiety, loneliness and extreme home-sickness. Physical symptoms are also possible, such as insomnia and difficulties with eating. 

What can help 

Remember that it is normal to need time to adjust to a new culture, environment  and way of life. Be kind to yourself.
Try to be open-minded to the new experiences and meeting new people. If you can find out why things are done differently here compared to your home country this understanding may help.
Register with a GP surgery at the earliest opportunity so that you have access to help with your physical and mental health if needed. It may be a good idea to speak to a GP in the Autumn to check that you are in good health before the British winter starts.
Contact the ISSS team(https://www.northampton.ac.uk/international/international-student-support/meet-the-team-isss/) who provide support and advice to international students 
Consider contacting community-based groups from your own country/continent so you don't feel isolated and have the chance to meet and talk to others about your home culture. Further details are available from ISSS team(https://www.northampton.ac.uk/international/international-student-support/meet-the-team-isss/).
Access all available academic support such as your Personal Academic Tutor(https://mynorthamptonac.sharepoint.com/sites/student/Pages/Your-Personal-Academic-Tutor.aspx) and dissertation/project supervisor. Also consider using Learning Development and Academic Librarians(https://mynorthamptonac.sharepoint.com/sites/student/Pages/Academic-support.aspx)
Consider using Counselling and Mental Health Team drop-ins (available weekdays by phone), or request longer appointments (which can be face to face) by emailing Counselling Service counsellors@northampton.ac.uk or Mental Health Service mha@northampton.ac.uk  
Consider visiting The Multi-Faith Centre(https://mynorthamptonac.sharepoint.com/sites/student/Pages/Multi--faith-chaplaincy.aspx) at Waterside Campus. The team draws from a number of faith traditions and works for the benefit of all students, providing pastoral support. There are facilities for prayer and ritual washing, as well as quiet space to reflect.




Depression:


What is depression?

​Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than days. It can be caused by a range of different factors like relationship issues, transitions and change, loneliness or low self-esteem, although, we can also experience depression without knowing what the trigger cause is. Gilbert (2007) defines depression across four different aspects of functioning. If you have experienced four or more of the warning signs below on most days over the past two weeks, then you may be affected by depression.

Depression
​Motivation
​Cognitive
​Emotional
​Biological
​Apathy

​Poor concentration

​Resentment

​Sleep disturbance

​Loss of energy

​Memory loss

​Guilt

​Poor appetite

​Loss of confidence

​Confusion

​Low self-esteem

​Lethargy



​If you have thoughts of suicide it's important you contact your GP(https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4) and make an appointment as soon as you can. Other crisis support is available by calling NHS on 111 or Samaritans on 116 123. The Counselling and Mental Health Service​ hold daily (Monday - Friday) drop-ins during term time.

​Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicationn. Your GP may prescribe ant​idepressants (depending on your circumstances) but other activities that may be suggested instead of or in addition to medication​ may include counselling, mindfulness, self-help books, online courses, exercise, and socialising with friends.
