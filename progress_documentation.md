# Mental Health Chatbot Development Documentation

## Project Overview

The Mental Health Chatbot is a Rasa-based conversational AI designed to provide support and resources to students experiencing mental health challenges. The chatbot can handle various intents related to mental health, provide appropriate resources, and respond to emergency situations.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup and Environment Configuration

- Created a Python virtual environment
- Installed Rasa and dependencies
- Initialized the Rasa project structure

### 2. Data Preparation and Model Design

#### Domain Configuration
- Defined intents for various mental health scenarios
- Created entities to extract key information (emotion_type, duration, triggers, severity)
- Configured slots to store information throughout the conversation
- Designed responses for different user inputs
- Added actions to handle conversation flow

#### NLU Training Data
- Created extensive examples for intents like:
  - Greeting/goodbye
  - Mood expressions (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Emergency situations
  - Requests for mental health services
  - Emotional expressions with entities
  - Relationship/study balance questions

#### Conversation Design
- Created rules to handle immediate responses (e.g., emergencies)
- Developed stories to handle complex conversation paths
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for unrecognized inputs

### 3. Issue Identification and Resolution

#### Duplicate Actions and Rules
- Identified conflicting rules related to emergency responses
- Fixed conflicts by standardizing action names across rule files
- Unified the response pattern for emergency situations

#### Missing Intent Definitions
- Added the `emergency_physical_health` intent to the domain
- Ensured all intents had corresponding rules and responses

#### Pipeline Configuration
- Updated the config.yml to include the correct language (en)
- Configured the appropriate NLU pipeline components
- Set up policies for effective conversation handling

### 4. Model Training

The model was trained with the following command:
```
python -m rasa train --data data/nlu/simple_nlu.yml data/rules/simple_rules.yml data/stories/simple_stories.yml --domain domain.yml --config config.yml --fixed-model-name improved_model
```

Training resulted in a model that shows high accuracy in intent classification and response prediction. The model was saved at 'models/20250328-215011-commutative-wasabi.tar.gz'.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Testing

#### NLU Testing
We tested the NLU component of the model using:
```
python -m rasa test nlu --nlu data/nlu/simple_nlu.yml --model models/20250328-215011-commutative-wasabi.tar.gz
```

Results:
- The NLU model showed excellent intent classification accuracy
- Entity extraction was precise with F1-score of 1.0 for the DIETClassifier

#### Core Testing
We tested the dialogue management component using:
```
python -m rasa test core --stories data/stories/simple_stories.yml --model models/20250328-215011-commutative-wasabi.tar.gz
```

Results:
- Conversation level accuracy: 100% (7/7 stories correct)
- Action level accuracy: 100% (35/35 actions correct)
- F1-Score: 1.000
- Precision: 1.000

The confusion matrix showed perfect prediction of all actions.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Emergency Response Handling**: The bot can recognize emergency situations and provide immediate resources and guidance.

2. **Emotion Recognition**: Identifies different emotional states and responds appropriately with empathy.

3. **Entity Extraction**: Captures important context about emotions, their triggers, duration, and severity.

4. **Mental Health Resources**: Provides information about available mental health services and support options.

5. **Relationship-Study Balance**: Offers advice on managing relationships alongside academic responsibilities.

## Improvements Made

1. **Fixed Rule Conflicts**: Resolved contradictions in rule definitions that were causing training errors.

2. **Streamlined Domain Definition**: Eliminated duplicate actions and ensured consistent naming.

3. **Enhanced NLU Examples**: Added more comprehensive examples for better intent recognition.

4. **Optimized Configuration**: Adjusted parameters in config.yml for better performance.

5. **Entity Recognition**: Improved entity extraction by providing diverse examples with proper annotations.

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Create more comprehensive test stories to ensure robust performance.

2. **Add Custom Actions**: Implement custom actions for more dynamic responses.

3. **Deploy to Interface**: Connect the chatbot to a web interface for user interaction.

4. **User Feedback Integration**: Implement a mechanism to collect and incorporate user feedback.

5. **Enhance Personality**: Further develop the chatbot's personality and response variations.

## Technical Architecture

- **NLU Pipeline**: Uses WhitespaceTokenizer, RegexFeaturizer, LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer, CountVectorsFeaturizer, DIETClassifier, EntitySynonymMapper, and ResponseSelector.

- **Policies**: Implements MemoizationPolicy, TEDPolicy, RulePolicy, and UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy for dialogue management.

- **Domain**: Contains 15+ intents, 4 entity types, corresponding slots, and multiple response templates.

- **Data Structure**: Organized in separate directories for NLU, stories, and rules.

This project demonstrates the effective application of Rasa for building a specialized mental health support chatbot, with careful attention to both technical implementation and sensitive response handling.
